This repository implements protocols for remotely-attested HTTPS and
WSS channels, which web pages can use to establish secure connections
that verifiably terminate inside trusted execution environments
(currently Intel TDX/SGX).

## Background

Trusted execution environments make it possible to build private and
verifiable web services, but one limitation that makes this harder is
that web pages cannot natively verify that they're connected to a
TEE. Browsers don't expose X.509 certificate extensions that can be
used to prove a connection terminates inside the secured environment,
so proxies like Cloudflare can trivially see and modify traffic to
TEEs forwarded through them. Anyone hosting a TEE app can easily
insert their own TLS proxy in front of it, breaking privacy and
extracting session data that lets them impersonate the user.

To work around this, some TEE application hosts implement their own
proxy in front of the TEE, but this simply moves trust to a different
proxy. Hosts may also use certificate log monitoring to boost security,
but this happens out-of-band and doesn't directly protect the
connection between the user and the TEE.

Applications using tee-channels can treat TEEs like a regular web
server, and use public certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt and
Cloudflare to protect them. Third parties can host copies of the same
application on IPFS or other immutable cloud services. The TEE channel
embeds an end-to-end TEE verification flow in the browser, including
quote verification, certificate revocation lists, and checks for TCB
firmware freshness.

## Features

- tee-channels-tunnel:
  - Establishes tunneled connections to a TEE through an encrypted
    WebSocket, after key exchange, quote validation, and CRL/TCB validation
  - Supports encrypted HTTP requests via a `fetch`-compatible API
  - Supports encrypted WebSockets via a `WebSocket`-compatible API
  - Includes a ServiceWorker for upgrading all HTTP requests from a
    browser page to use the encrypted channel
- tee-channels-qvl:
  - WebCrypto-based SGX/TDX quote verification library
  - Validates the full chain of trust from the root CA, down to binding
    the public key of the encrypted channel in `report_data`
  - Includes optional CRL/TCB validation inside the browser. (TCB info
    cannot be fetched from Intel using JavaScript without a CORS proxy.)
- tee-channels-demo:
  - A [demo application](https://tee-channels.vercel.app/) that supports
    HTTPS and WSS requests over the encrypted channel, both with and without
    the embedded ServiceWorker.

## Usage

On the client, create a `TunnelClient()` object. You should switch out
unencrypted Node.js `fetch` and `WebSocket` instances for our `fetch` and
`WebSocket` wrappers, exposed on the `TunnelClient()`.

It is your responsibility to configure TunnelClient with the expected
`mrtd` and `report_data` measurements, certificate revocation lists,
verify the TCB manually inside any custom quote validator.

Your client will validate all measurements, quote signatures, and
additional CRL/TCB info before opening a connection.

```ts
import { TunnelClient } from "tee-channels-tunnel"
import { hex, parseTdxQuote } from "tee-channels-qvl"

async function main() {
  const origin = "http://127.0.0.1:3000"

  // You can validate against expected mrtd/report_data or provide a custom matcher.
  // Below shows fixed values; compute these from an expected quote if you have one.
  const expectedMrtd = '...' /* hex string */
  const expectedReportData = '...' /* hex string */

  const client = await TunnelClient.initialize(origin, {
    mrtd: expectedMrtd,
    report_data: expectedReportData,
    crl: [], // certificate revocation list
    verifyTcb: ({ ... }) => true, // check for TCB freshness
    // sgx: true // defaults to TDX otherwise
  })

  // HTTP over tunnel
  const res = await client.fetch("/hello")
  console.log(await res.text()) // server replies "world"

  // WebSocket over tunnel
  const ws = new client.WebSocket(origin.replace(/^http/, "ws"))
  ws.addEventListener("open", () => ws.send("ping"))
  ws.addEventListener("message", (evt: any) => console.log(String(evt.data)))
}

main()
```

On the server, add a `TunnelServer` middleware to your Node.js/Express
server. We only support Node.js now, but future versions will support
arbitrary backends through Nginx.

```ts
import express from "express"
import { TunnelServer } from "tee-channels-tunnel"

async function main() {
  const app = express()
  app.get("/hello", (_req, res) => res.status(200).send("world"))

  async function getQuote(x25519PublicKey: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
    // Return a Uint8Array quote, optionally binding it to x25519PublicKey
    return Uint8Array.fromHex('...')
  }
  const tunnelServer = await TunnelServer.initialize(app, getQuote)

  // Optional: WebSocket support via the built-in mock server
  tunnelServer.wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
    ws.on("message", (data: any) => ws.send(data))
  })

  tunnelServer.server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("tee-channels service listening on :3000")
  })
}

main()
```

You may also use the included ServiceWorker to transparently upgrade
HTTP GET/POST requests to go over the encrypted channel to your
`TunnelServer`.

To do this, first add the ServiceWorker plugin to your bundler. You
can use an included Vite plugin to handle this, or manually serve
`__ra-serviceworker__.js` at your web root from
`node_modules/tee-channels-tunnel/lib/sw.build.js`::

```js
// vite.config.js
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import { includeRaServiceWorker } from "tee-channels-tunnel/sw"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), includeRaServiceWorker()],
})
```

Then, register the ServiceWorker at app startup, pointed at your
tunnel origin:

```ts
// src/main.tsx (or similar)
import { registerServiceWorker } from "tee-channels-tunnel/register"

const baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:3000" // your TunnelServer origin
registerServiceWorker(baseUrl)
```

Note that different browsers vary in their support of ServiceWorkers,
and some browsers may block ServiceWorkers from being installed.

By default, ServiceWorkers intercept link clicks, location.assign()
calls, subresource requests, and fetch() / XMLHttpRequest requests
(but not WebSockets).

## Demo

The packages/demo directory contains a demo of a chat app that relays
WebSocket messages and fetch requests over an encrypted channel.

Node v22 is expected.

Run the client using `tsx`:

```
npm run dev
```

Run the server using Node.js:

```
npm run server
```

## Architecture

The tunnel performs a key exchange and attestation check before
allowing any traffic. After the handshake, all payloads are CBOR
encoded and encrypted with the XSalsa20â€‘Poly1305 stream cipher
(libsodium `crypto_secretbox`).

1. Client opens a control WebSocket to the server at
   `ws(s)://<host>:<port>/__ra__`.
2. Server immediately sends `server_kx` with an X25519 public key and
   a TDX/SGX attestation quote.
3. Client verifies the quote (using `tee-channels-qvl`), optionally
   enforces `mrtd`/`report_data` or a custom matcher, generates a
   symmetric key, and sends it sealed to the server via `client_kx`
   (libsodium `crypto_box_seal`).
4. All subsequent messages are encrypted envelopes
   `{ type: "enc", nonce, ciphertext }` carrying tunneled HTTP
   and WebSocket messages.

## Limitations

- For security reasons, we currently require that all WebSocket connections to the HTTP server go through the encrypted channel. Mixing and matching unencrypted WebSockets and tee-channels is not supported.
- One keypair is generated per server process. No key rotation (yet) or support for load balancing across TEEs.
- HTTP request/response bodies are buffered end-to-end; very large payloads cannot be streamed.
- HTTP request bodies supported: string, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, and `ReadableStream` (no`FormData`).
- Our `WebSocket.send` does not accept `Blob`; convert blobs to `ArrayBuffer` or `Uint8Array` first.
- The default client request timeout is 30s and not configurable at this time.
- WebSocket messages queued before `open` are automatically flushed once the socket opens.
